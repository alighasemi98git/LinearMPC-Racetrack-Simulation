# Linear Model Predictive Control â€“ Racetrack Assignment

This project is part of the **EL2700 â€“ Model Predictive Control** course at KTH. It focuses on implementing a **Linear Model Predictive Controller (MPC)** for vehicle path tracking on a racetrack. Building on the previous LQR assignment, this project extends to constrained optimization, horizon tuning, and stability enhancements with terminal costs and dual-mode horizons.

## Project Overview

* **Problem Type:** Linear MPC with constraints
* **Context:** Vehicle dynamics & racing applications
* **Key Features:**

  * Discrete-time linearized vehicle model
  * Feedforward reference trajectory `(xff, uff)`
  * MPC design for state & input error stabilization
  * Constraint handling on steering, lateral velocity, and torque
  * Stability analysis via terminal cost scaling and dual-mode horizon
  * Performance comparison across horizons, solvers, and warm-start strategies

## Tasks

1. **MPC Formulation**

   * Define state & input error dynamics
   * Set up optimization problem in CVXPY
   * Include cost, dynamics, state/input constraints, and initial condition

2. **MPC Implementation**

   * Implement `setup_mpc_problem` (define variables, parameters, constraints)
   * Implement `solve_mpc` (return optimal first control input)

3. **LQR vs MPC Comparison**

   * Compare MPC optimal inputs with LQR baseline
   * Validate asymptotic stability and cost decay

4. **Controller Tuning**

   * Select cost matrices `(Q, R)` using Brysonâ€™s rule or heuristics
   * Evaluate response trade-offs: tracking accuracy vs. control effort

5. **Constraints**

   * Add realistic limits:

     * Steering angle: |Î´| â‰¤ 35Â°
     * Lateral velocity: |vy| â‰¤ 3.1 m/s
     * Steering rate: |uÎ´| â‰¤ 50 rad/s
     * Torque: |ur| â‰¤ 60 Nm

6. **Terminal Cost Tuning**

   * Scale terminal cost `QT = Î»P` with Î» âˆˆ {2, 10, 50, 100}
   * Analyze how Î» affects stability and performance

7. **Performance Experiments**

   * Vary horizon length N âˆˆ {20, 40, 80}
   * Compare solvers: MOSEK vs CLARABEL
   * Test warm-start on/off for speedup

8. **Bonus: Dual-Mode Horizon**

   * Implement extended horizon with dual states
   * Compare stability guarantees with standard MPC

## Results

* MPC matches LQR when unconstrained, but outperforms it under constraints.
* Larger horizons improve performance but increase computational time.
* Terminal cost scaling (Î») critical for ensuring closed-loop stability.
* Warm-starting and solver choice significantly affect runtime feasibility.
